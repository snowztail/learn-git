## Rewriting history with Git

While version control is useful to keep track of changes made to a piece of work over
time, it also lets you to modify the timeline of commits. There are several totally
legitimate reasons why you might want to do that, from keeping the commit history clean
of unsuccessful attempts to do something to incorporate work done by someone else.

This episode explores some of the commands `git` offers to manipulate the commit history
for your benefit and that of your collaborators.

### Amend

This is the simplest method of rewriting history: it lets you amend the last commit you
made, maybe adding some files you forgot to stage or fixing a typo in the commit message.

After you have made those last minute changes - and `staged` them, if needed - all you
need to do to amend the last commit while keeping the same commit message is:

```bash
$ git commit --amend --no-edit
```

Or this:

```bash
$ git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

if you want to write a new commit message:

Note that this will replace the previous commit with a new one - the commit hash will be
different, so this approach must not be used if the commit was already pushed to the
remote repository and shared with collaborators.

### Reset

The next level of complexity rewriting history is `reset`: it lets you redo the
last (or last few) commit(s) you made so you can incorporate more changes, fix an error
you have spotted and that is worth incorporating as part of that commit and not as a
separate one or just improve your commit message.

```bash
$ git reset --soft HEAD^
```

This resets the staging area to match the most recent commit, but leaves the working
directory unchanged - so no information is lost. Now you can review the files you
modified, make more changes or whatever you like. When you are ready, you stage and
commit your files, as usual. You can go back 2 commits, 3, etc with `HEAD^2`,
`HEAD^3`... but the further you go, the more chances there are to leave commits
without a parent commit. Resulting in a messy (but potentially recoverable) repository,
as information is not lost. You can read about this recovery process in this [blog post in
Medium](https://www.ocpsoft.org/tutorials/git/use-reflog-and-cherry-pick-to-restore-lost-commits/).

A way more dangerous option uses the flag `--hard`. When doing this, you completely
remove the commits up to the specified one, updating the files in the working directory
accordingly. In other words, **any work done since the chosen commit will be completely
erased**.

To undo just the last commit, you can do:
~~~
$ git reset --hard HEAD^
~~~
{: .commands}

Otherwise, to go back in time to a specific commit, you would do:
~~~
$ git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
~~~
{: .commands}

### Removing branches once you are done with them is good practice
Over time, you will accumulate lots of branches to implement different features in you
code. It is good practice to remove them once they have fulfil their purpose. You can do
that using the `-D` flag with the `git branch` command:

~~~
$ git branch -D BRANCH_NAME
~~~
{: .commands}

### Reverting a commit

As pointed out, using `reset` can be dangerous and it is not suitable if you need to be
more surgical in what you want to change, affecting just what was done on a commit a
while ago, potentially already shared with collaborators. To address that, we have
`revert`.

`git revert` creates a commit that exactly cancels the changes made by a previous one.
It is a new commit, so it is part of the history, but its purpose is to undo something
done in the past.

The syntax in this case is:
~~~
$ git revert --no-edit COMMIT_HASH
~~~
{: .commands}

You can omit the `--no-edit` flag and use `-m` to give a one-line description for the
process or also omit `-m` to enter into the default text editor to leave a more complete
description and rationale for the revert.

This is yet another good example of why making separate commits for each change is a
good idea, so they can, potentially, be reversed if needed in the future with no fuss.

### Set aside your work safely with `stash`

It is not rare that, while you are working on some feature, you need to check something
else in another branch. Very often this is the case when you want to try some
contributor's code as part of a pull request review process (see next episodes). You
can commit the work you are doing, but if it is not in a state ready to be committed,
what would you do?

`git stash` is the answer. It lets you put your current, uncommitted work aside in a
special state, turning the working directory back to the way it was in the last commit.
Then, you can easily switch branches, pull new ones or do whatever you want. Once you
are ready to go back to work, you can recover the stashed work and continue as if
nothing had happened.

The following are the `git stash` commands needed to make this happen:

Stash the current state of the repository, giving some message to remind yourself what
was this about. The working directory becomes identical to the last commit.
~~~
$ git stash save "Some informative message"
~~~
{: .commands}

List the stashes available in reverse chronological order (last one stashed goes on
top).
~~~
$ git stash list
~~~
{: .commands}

Extract the **last stash** of the list, updating the working directory
with its content.
~~~
$ git stash pop
~~~
{: .commands}

Extract the stash with the given number from the list, updating the working directory
with its content.
~~~
$ git stash pop stash@{NUMBER}
~~~
{: .commands}

Apply the **last stash** without removing it from the list, so you can apply it to
other branches, if needed.
~~~
$ git stash apply
~~~
{: .commands}

Apply the given stash without removing it from the list, so you can apply it to
other branches, if needed.
~~~
$ git stash apply stash@{NUMBER}
~~~
{: .commands}

If you want more information, you can [read this article on Git
stash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash).

> ## Practice stashing
>
> Now try using `git stash` with the recipe repository. For example:
> - Add some ingredients then stash the changes (do not stage or commit them)
> - Modify the instructions and also stash those change
> 
> Then have a look at the list of stashes and bring those changes back to the
> working directory using `stash pop` and `stash apply`, and see how the list of
> stashes changes in either case.

### Incorporate past commits with `rebase`

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base
commit. In other words, you take a collection of commits that you have created that
branched off a particular commit and make them appear as if they branched off a
different one.

The most common use case for `git rebase` happens when you are working on your feature
branch (let's say `experiment`) and, in the meantime there have been commits done to the
base branch (for example, `main`). You might want to use in your own work some upstream
changes done by someone else or simply keep the history of the repository linear,
facilitating merging back in the future.

The command is straightforward:
~~~
$ git rebase NEW_BASE
~~~
{: .commands}
where `NEW_BASE` can be either a commit hash or a branch name we want to use as the new
base.

The following figure illustrates the process where, after rebasing, the two commits of
the feature branch have been recreated after the last commit of the main branch.

"Rebase process with a feature branch being moved to another branch")

rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase).
