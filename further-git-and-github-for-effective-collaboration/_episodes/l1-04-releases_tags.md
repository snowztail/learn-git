## Background: To release or not to release?

All of you will already be familiar with the concept of software versioning. Often when
you download a piece of software from its website it'll tell you that it's `v13.4.2` (or
whatever) that you're downloading.

Releasing software with an explicit version number like this is a common practice and
one that you may eventually consider for some of your own projects. We will show you how
to do this using Git and GitHub. Even if you never end up making a release yourself,
rest assured that sooner or later you will have to work with a repository which uses
releases like this, so it's important to understand the concepts at least.

The first question you might have is:

### Why do I need a "version" for my software? Isn't Git tracking the version anyway?

Sort of. The problem here is that the word "version" can mean several different things
in the context of Git. Ordinarily, when people talk about a particular version of a
piece of software, they mean a version with a particular release number, such as
`v13.4.2`. However, in another sense, each commit in your repository represents a
different version of the code and can be represented by a unique commit hash (e.g.
`047e4fe`).

To avoid confusion, people usually refer to the first kind of version as a "release" and
the second as a "commit", which is what we'll do here.

### When should I consider creating releases?

You *might* consider creating releases if:

- You have a large, distributed user base and you don't want them just using some
  random commit from your repository
- You periodically add or change features in a non-backwards-compatible way
- You want to bundle these features together and advertise them to your users
- Your software is complex and you can't guarantee that every commit on `main` has been
  thoroughly tested
- You want to be able to support several versions of your software simultaneously (e.g.
  you intend to maintain a v2 of your software, even after v3 has been released)
- You want to provide a place to download files that you've generated (such as `.exe`
  files) and distribute them to users

In general, though, creating a release is also just a convenient way to label a
particular commit, so it's a useful way to ensure that the users you're sharing it with
-- who may not be technically savvy -- are using a specific commit, rather than simply
whatever the latest commit on `main` is.

### When *don't* I need to create releases for my software?

You probably don't need to create releases for your software if:

- The code never changes
- You're the only developer and the only user (e.g. it's some analysis scripts that only
  you use)
- (OR there are only a few of you and you all just use the latest commit etc.)
- The software is simple and doesn't change much from one commit to the next

In this case, if you just need to clarify which commit you're working from (e.g. to a
colleague), remember that you can always obtain the current commit hash like so:

~~~sh
$ git rev-parse --short HEAD
~~~
{: .commands}
~~~
047e4fe
~~~
{: .output}

## Labelling a particular commit with `git tag`

Git tags provide a way to give human-readable names to specific commits. We will now
go through how to add and remove tags to your repository.

Firstly, remind yourself what the history for your `recipe` repository looks like with
`git log`. Mine looks like this:

~~~
$ git log

(Note that yours may look different depending on whether you followed the steps yourself
or downloaded the pre-made repository.)

Let's say that you have decided that the point at which you added half an onion was a
highpoint in the recipe's history and you want to make a note of which commit that was
for a future date by giving it the tag "tasty".  You can do this like so:

~~~
$ git tag tasty [commit hash]
~~~

In my case, I ran:

~~~
$ git tag tasty 366f4b5
~~~

You can list the tags for your repo by running `git tag` without any arguments:

~~~
$ git tag
~~~
{: .commands}
~~~
tasty
~~~
{: .output}

To check which commit hash this corresponds to, use:

~~~
$ git rev-parse --short tasty
~~~
{: .commands}
~~~
366f4b5
~~~
{: .output}

Double-check that this is the commit you intended to tag by running `git log` (or
`git graph`) again.

Note that `tasty` can now be used like other git references, such as commit hashes and
branch names. For example, you can run `git checkout tasty` to (temporarily) update the
contents of your repo to be as they were back when you added half an onion to the
instructions.

You may now be wondering, if this is the case, then how is a tag different from a
branch? Try checking out `tasty` to see what happens:

~~~
git checkout tasty
~~~
{: .commands}

~~~
Note: switching to 'tasty'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

    git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

    git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 366f4b5 Added 1/2 onion to ingredients
~~~
{: .output}

Git provides some helpful output describing what you've just done (although note that we
don't cover the `git switch` command in this course). The "detached `HEAD` state" is
git's way of saying that your repo is not on any branch at all, so if you commit any
changes, they won't be saved to any branch. Note that your tag will stay pointing to the
same commit it was before. *This* is the difference between a branch and a tag. The tip
of a branch points to the last committed change to the branch, whereas a tag always
points to a specific commit. Think about it this way: when you release a piece of
software, you want that version -- say, v1.0 -- to represent the code *in one unique
state*. You don't want two of your users to be using two different versions of the code
both labelled v1.0, for example.

Fortunately, a detached `HEAD` is a much less serious affliction for git repos than
human beings, and you can reattach it by simply checking out a branch:

~~~
$ git checkout main
~~~

Assume now that you have decided that you no longer want this tag (perhaps on eating, it
turned out not to be tasty after all). You can delete the tag like so:

~~~
$ git tag -d tasty
~~~
{: .commands}
~~~
Deleted tag 'tasty' (was 366f4b5)

There is one last important thing to know about git tags. Like branches, they are not
automatically synced with your remote (e.g. GitHub) and have to be pushed explicitly. We
will cover this later, but first let's discuss how to give your software a descriptive
version number.

## What's in a version number?

While your code will no doubt smell as sweet however you number your releases, it is
useful for your users if you use a versioning scheme that conveys some information about
the kind of thing that is likely to have changed since the last version. Unfortunately,
this practice is not universal. Often with software releases, the meaning behind the
version number is rather opaque, except for the fact that higher numbers generally mean
"newer". It often isn't obvious to what extent a new version of a piece of software is
compatable with older versions -- if at all!

Amidst this confusion, a convention that is becoming increasingly common is so-called
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A semantic version number is composed of
three numbers separated by dots, e.g. `v1.2.3`. In order, these numbers are referred to
as the "major version", "minor version" and "patch version". Generally speaking, changes
to the numbers are less significant as you go to the right, i.e. an increase in the
major version number indicates that more has changed than an increase in the minor
version number.

However, the semantic versioning specification actually has stricter requirements than
this, namely that you should increment:

1. The **major** version when you make incompatible changes
2. The **minor** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
3. The **patch** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

While this degree of precision may not be required for any of your own projects, it is a
good convention to stick to nonetheless as other developers will probably assume that
this is what you are using.

Let's add a proper version tag to the `recipe` repository. Give the first commit to the
repository (in mine this is `6ff8aa5`) the tag `v0.0.1`, which is often used as the
first tagged release for a project. (Another common convention is to indicate that the
software is still experimental by giving it a major version number of zero.)

~~~
$ git tag v0.0.1 6ff8aa5
~~~

Verify that the tag has been added:

~~~
git tag
~~~
{: .commands}
~~~
v0.0.1
~~~
{: .output}

Now your repository has a proper version tag. Next, let's push this tag to GitHub so the
rest of the world can see it.

## Pushing your tags and publishing a release

To push your tags to GitHub, do the following:

~~~
$ git push --tags
~~~
{: .commands}

You should see something like this:

~~~
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/alexdewar/recipe.git
 * [new tag]         v0.0.1 -> v0.0.1
~~~
{: .output}

Now open your browser and go to the GitHub page for your recipe repository (see the link
in the command output). [Mine is here, for
example.](https://github.com/alexdewar/recipe)

If you look in the right-hand pane, under "Releases", you should now see "1 tags":

![1 tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/releases_repo.png "1 tags")

This refers to the `v0.0.1` tag you just pushed. (If there are two tags, you may have
forgotten to delete the `tasty` tag, which doesn't matter much.)

Under "1 tags", there is a link entitled "Create a new release". Click it and you should
see something like the following:

![Creating a new release]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/releases_new_release.png "Creating a
new release")

Click "Choose a tag" then select your tag "v0.0.1" from the dropdown list:

![Choose your tag]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/releases_choose_a_tag.png "Choose your tag")

For the release title, you can just put "v0.0.1" again. Then add a description of your
choosing. (You can check the "Set as pre-release" box if you want to indicate to your
users that the recipe isn't production ready.) Note that there is another field: "Attach
binaries". We won't be using this now, but if you did have a compiled version of your
software (e.g. as an `.exe` file), this is where you could upload it.

When you're finished, click "Publish
release":

![Publish your release]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/releases_publish.png "Publish your
release")

Now you should be redirected to a page that looks like this:

![View release]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/releases_view.png "View release")

Congratulations, you have made your first release! You can share the link to this page
with others if you want to notify them of the release. Alternatively, users can find
your release from the repo's main page by clicking on "Releases".
