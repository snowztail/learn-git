## Explanation of CI

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice that ensures all
contributions to a code base meet defined criteria (e.g. formatting or testing
conventions). This is enforced via computational workflows that apply checks and
tests to a code commit. Failure of these workflows to complete successfully is
indicated via the code hosting platform and can be used to block code from being
merged into branches.

CI is often paired with additional workflows that run after a
code contribution has been accepted. These workflows are often used to publish or deploy
the code for use, a practice known as continuous delivery (CD). Generally the terms CI,
CD or CI/CD can be used somewhat interchangeably to refer to any computational workflows
that are triggered by and influence changes in a code base for a variety of purposes.

CI is carried out by a CI (or CI/CD) system. There are a wide variety of CI systems
available. Some are closely integrated with a particular code hosting platform
(e.g. [GitHub Actions] for GitHub, [GitLab CI/CD] for GitLab), others are provided as
third-party online services (e.g. [CircleCI], [Travis CI]) and others are designed for
you to setup and run yourself (e.g. [Jenkins], [Buildbot]).

[CircleCI]: https://circleci.com/
[GitHub Actions]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
[GitLab CI/CD]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/
[Travis CI]: https://www.travis-ci.com/
[Buildbot]: https://buildbot.net/
[Jenkins]: https://www.jenkins.io/

We're going to look at how to setup and use GitHub Actions for the following reasons:

- It is the integrated CI system for GitHub.
- It is hosted online without the need to register for additional services/accounts.
- The College has invested in a Licence for GitHub that brings additional benefits.

## Introduction to GitHub Actions

There are two requirements to use GitHub Actions:

1. You must have a repository on GitHub with Actions enabled. This is the default in the
   majority of circumstances but Actions may be initially disabled on a fork. You can
   check by going to the Actions Settings in the GitHub user interface (under Settings
   -> Actions -> General).
1. Your repository must contain a workflow file in the directory `.github/workflows`. A
   workflow file contains the instructions that specify when your CI should run and what
   to do when it runs. You can have as many workflow files as you want and they will all
   run simultaneously.

### Configuring and Running GitHub Actions

An example of a very simple workflow file is below:

```yaml
on:
  - push
jobs:
  check-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo 'hello world'
```

This roughly translates to the following: "When I push new code to GitHub, use the
Ubuntu operating system to checkout the code and then run the specified command".

> ## YAML File Format
>
> You may not have encountered the YAML file format before. YAML is very commonly used
> for configuration files because it allows the definition of structured data whilst
> also being pretty easy for people to read.
>
> That being said, it can take a moment to get your head around. When starting out it's
> generally best to start with an example and modify it. We'll break down the meaning
> and structure of this YAML file as we go.
{: .callout}

Let's breakdown the example workflow file in a bit more detail:

```yaml
on:
  - push
```

This describes the condition that will trigger the workflow to run. To add another
trigger you would add another indented line with a dash, e.g.

```yaml
on:
  - push
  - pull_request
```

This will additionally trigger the workflow to run when a pull request is created. The
"push" and "pull_request" triggers are probably the most commonly used however, there
are a great many available (see [GitHub Docs: Events that trigger
workflows][actions-triggers]). This is an example of where GitHub Actions goes further
than most CI systems as you can automate pretty much any behaviour in a repository.

[actions-triggers]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#available-events

Next chunk:

```yaml
jobs:
  check-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

Workflows are composed of jobs that in turn are composed of steps. In the above we
create a job called `check-code` by creating an entry in the `jobs` section. We specify
that the job should run on the most recent version available of Ubuntu (a flavour of
Linux). Then we go on to define the steps within the job. To add another job to this
workflow we would add another entry with the same indentation as `check-code` with a
different name and its own `runs-on` entry and `steps`.

You can read more about jobs at [GitHub Docs: Using jobs in a workflow][jobs]. The
behaviour of jobs can be extensively modified. You can create dependencies between jobs
so that `job-2` will only run if `job-1` finished successfully. Or you can provide
additional expressions to limit when a job should run e.g. only run a job for a
particular branch. You can also define a single job that is run multiple times with
different parameters using a matrix. This can be used, for instance, to test code on
multiple different operating systems with different versions of Python. See [GitHub
Docs: Using a matrix for your jobs][matrix] for more information.

[matrix]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs
[jobs]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo 'hello world'
```

Individual steps within a job define the actual work to be carried out. The workflow
above defines two steps that work in different ways. The first step has a `uses` entry
to indicate that it should use a pre-packaged action. This is a powerful feature of
GitHub Actions; individual job steps can be packaged and shared for use in workflows in
different repositories. Actions that have been packaged this way can be found in the
[GitHub MarketPlace]. Here we're using version 3 of the `checkout` action which is
almost always the first step in any job. The `checkout` action will create a copy of
your repository's code ready for following steps in the job.

The default behaviour of the `checkout` action is quite smart. It tries to check out the
correct version of your code based on the context of the workflow. For instance, it will
checkout a newly pushed branch if that is the event that triggered the workflow. You can
modify the behaviour of individual actions by passing a `with` section. For instance you
can make the action checkout a different version of your code or checkout code from a
different repository entirely. See [GitHub Market Place: Checkout Action][checkout] for
details.

[checkout]: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout

The second step does not use a pre-packaged action but instead has a `run` entry. This
allows us to execute some custom code. As a general rule, if you can find a pre-packaged
action in the Marketplace that does what you want, use it, and only fall back to running
custom code if necessary. For more detail on custom job steps see [GitHub Docs: Job Step
Workflow Syntax][step-syntax].

[step-syntax]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun

Once those two steps have completed, the CI run is finished. What happens next
depends on what happened during the job steps. If any step did not finish successfully,
but instead generated an error, then the CI run is considered to have failed. Successful
CI runs are marked in the GitHub UI with a green dot next to the commit; failed runs
have a red dot.

### Using CI with Pull Requests

We've seen some basic usage of GitHub Actions but, so far, its only utility is adding a
tick or cross in the GitHub UI. That's good, but CI can be even more useful when
combined with pull requests.

Let's say we've created a new branch that we want to merge into main. If we create a
pull request but our CI is failing in the new branch, we'll see something like the
following:

![Failing CI]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/pr_failing_ci.png "Panel from GitHub pull request
user interface showing failing CI checks"){:class="img-responsive"}

GitHub makes the failure of the CI pretty apparent but, by default, it will still allow
the PR to be merged. At this point the CI is a useful aid to peer review but we can
take things further by implementing some policy in the form of a "branch protection
rule". We can use this to put two restrictions in place:

1. No code can be pushed directly to the `main` branch, it must always be added via pull
   request.
1. All CI workflows must succeed in order for PR's to be allowed to merge.

Combined together these rules mean that **no code can end up in the `main` branch if it
did not successfully pass through CI first**. Creating a cast iron guarantee that all
code that has been accepted into the `main` branch meets a certain standard is very
powerful.

Let's see how to create a branch protection rule and how this changes the behaviour of
PR's:

1. Go to the `Settings` tab and select `Branches` from the left-hand side.
1. Select `Add branch protection rule`.
1. Set `main` as the `Branch name pattern` and check the boxes for `Require a pull
   request before merging` and `Require status checks to pass before merging`.
1. In the extra options that appear beneath the status checks checkbox, check `Require
   branches to be up to date before merging`. Using the search bar, find and select the
   names of any CI jobs that must pass to allow merging.
1. Scroll down and press `Create`. GitHub may ask you to confirm your password.

Now a CI failure for a pull request looks like this:

![Failing CI]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/pr_protected_failing_ci.png "Panel from GitHub pull
request user interface showing failing CI checks with merging blocked due to a branch
protection rule"){:class="img-responsive"}

Now it's much harder to get anything past peer review that doesn't meet the required
standard. There remains an option to "bypass branch protections" but this is only
available to administrators of the repository and can be removed by further refining the
rule.

### No Such Thing as a Free Lunch

Despite concerted efforts to look like your best mate, GitHub is in fact trying to make
money. At the end of the day GitHub Actions uses computational power which costs (even
if you are owned by Microsoft). The practical upshot is that there are limits on the
usage of GitHub Actions. In brief:

- Current usage limits and billing policies can be found at [GitHub Docs: About billing
  for GitHub Actions][billing].
- GitHub Actions is free for publicly accessible repositories.
- GitHub Actions for private repositories is restricted (see above link).
- Imperial College pays for a GitHub licence that provides compute minutes and storage
  even for private repositories. You must be a member of the ImperialCollegeLondon
  GitHub organisation and your repository must be created within the organisation to
  benefit. Details of how to join the organisation can be found at [Working With
  GitHub.com][github-org].
- Billing varies depending on the operating system used by your jobs. Running on Windows
  or MacOS is more expensive.

[github-org]: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/research-support-systems/github/working-with-githubcom/

## Ways to use CI

Now that we've set up and configured GitHub Actions, what can we use it for? The [GitHub
Marketplace] is a good place to get ideas but the number of available actions can be
overwhelming.

[GitHub MarketPlace]: https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions

### Enforce Style and Formatting

One of the simplest uses of CI is to enforce common style and formatting standards to
code. The below workflow runs [Flake8] to check that all Python code in the repository
conforms to the PEP8 style guide. Having this workflow ensures that all code added to
the repository has a consistent style and appearance.

[Flake8]: https://flake8.pycqa.org/

```yaml
on:
  - push
jobs:
  qa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - uses: py-actions/flake8@v2
```

### Build Software

Depending on your project you may have a compile or build step needed to make the
software usable. An example is given below of building a project using the CMake
toolchain. Common compilers (e.g. gcc, g++) and tools (e.g. Make) are pre-installed but
you may need additional setup actions if you have specific requirements for different
versions.

The value of this kind of workflow is pretty straightforward. You can check that a
freshly checked out version of your code can be successfully built. You can run similar
builds across a variety of operating systems and compilers to ensure broad
compatibility.

```yaml
on:
  - push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/actions-setup-cmake@v1
        with:
          cmake-version: "3.3"
      - run: |
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake ..
          make all
```

### Run Tests

Writing tests is an important best practice for software development. Even better is
incorporating tests into your CI so you know they pass in a newly checked-out repository
on another computer.

The below shows an example of running the tests of a Python project:

```yaml
on:
  - push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - run: pytest .
```

### Publish

Once we've accepted changes into our repository it can then be useful to trigger a
publish action. The below workflow builds and publishes a Docker image only when new
commits are added to the `main` branch. Docker is a tool for packaging and distributing
software along with all of its requirements. Once published the Docker image can then
be downloaded and used by other users or services.

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Get image metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v3
        with:
          images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
```

### A Realistic Example

If we put together a few things we've seen so far, we can start to build more realistic
and useful workflows. The below example is taken from a template for Python
repositories (see [Github Python Poetry Template Repository][poetry]).

[poetry]: https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/poetry_template_2/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml

```yaml
name: Test and build  # workflows can have a name that appears in the GitHub UI
on: [push, pull_request, release]
jobs:
  qa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # pre-commit is a useful tool to setup and run all of your QA tools at once
      # see https://pre-commit.com/
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0

  # this job checks that any links included in markdown files (such as the README) work
  check-links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1
        name: Check links in markdown files  # individual steps can also have names
        with:
          use-quiet-mode: 'yes'
          use-verbose-mode: 'yes'

  test:
    needs: qa
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}  # example of how jobs can be parameterised
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:  # here we use a matrix to test our project on different operating systems
        os: [ windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macos-latest ]
        python-version: [ 3.9 ]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install Poetry
      uses: abatilo/actions-poetry@v2.1.6
      with:
        poetry-version: 1.1.14
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: poetry install
    - name: Run tests
      run: poetry run pytest
```
